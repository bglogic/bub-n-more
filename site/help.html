<h2>Make your own levels</h2>

<p>Paxed has written an online level editor, but it is down nowadays.  You could build your levels on this web page, and save them locally in order to play them.  The level files should be stored in the <code>bubbob/levels</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>If you are interested in editing the levels locally with a text editor, read on.  Level files come in two flavours: <code>.bin</code> and <code>.py</code>.  The former are MacBinary files from the <a href="http://www.mcsebi.de">original MacOS9 game</a>.  The latter are the levels that we did ourselves.  To make new levels directly with a text editor, copy for example <code>CompactLevels.py</code> to a new name, and open it with any text editor.  The structure should be fairly simple to understand even without knowledge about Python.  Just don't try to look at <code>RandomLevels.py</code> first <code>:-)</code></p>


<br><hr><br><a name="server">
<h2>Notes on the server</h2>

The server is the single program that computes all the game for all the players, but doesn't display anything.  It should be run on the fastest machine, or even better on another machine of your local network where no one is playing (although modern computers don't have any trouble running both the server and a client).

<p>The server can be run in the command-line only; try <code>cd bubbob</code> and <code>python bb.py --help</code>.</p>


<br><hr><br><a name="client">
<h2>Notes on the client</h2>

If you want to understand a bit more what's going on with all these different ways to run the client (display) part, read on.

The client will run in <strong>any one</strong> of the following -- make sure you do have one of these, in order of preference:
<ul>
<li><p><a ref="http://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a>. This is a cool gaming library for Python. It is available for quite a lot of platforms. (Also see the kitchensink link above for MacOS X.) This gives the nicer results, so if you can install it, go ahead! You'll get transparency effects on the bubbles!</p>

<p>or</p>

<li><p>MS Windows. (It means that Bub &amp; Bros runs natively on Windows; but you can also install Pygame on top of Windows for the nicer bubbles <code>:-)</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<li><p>The X Window system (the graphical environment of Unix/Linux). The native X Window system is pretty fast under Bub &amp; Bros, so try this if you have a slow Unix/Linux machine. Note that you could also try it on MacOSX's X11 (I guess you need to start <code>display/Client.py</code> from an <code>xterm</code> command-line for this to work).</p>

<p>or</p>

<li><p>GTK (the Gnome environment) if the <a href="http://www.pygtk.org">PyGTK bindings</a> are installed. Unlike the other drivers this one offers you the ability to scale the window, zooming its content in or out. Use it if your screen has a specially large or small resolution.</p>

<p>or</p>

<li><p>A Java-enabled web browser. No installation required. (But you won't have the nice background musics when playing in the browser, so I'd recommend that you try one of the solutions above as well, to really enjoy the game.)</p>

</ul>

<p>The client can also be run from the command-line; try <code>cd display</code> and <code>python Client.py --help</code>.</p>


<br><hr><br><a name="trouble">
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
<li>If, before you even try to join a game, you are stuck at some point (where nothing occurs, no window opens,...) then you may be able to have a hint at what is going wrong by looking near the end of the log file, which is created under the name <code>BubBob.log</code> besides <code>BubBob.py</code>, or under the name <code>bb.log</code> in the Windows Temp directory.  If you can't make sense of it feel free to send it to us (address below).

<li>Firewalls and NAT systems are the most common cause for preventing connexions with Internet servers.  NAT systems are routers, common for example in ADSL setups, that allow a sub-network to use private IP addresses like <code>192.168.1.2</code>.  The various programs (client, server, meta-server) are doing their very best to connect to each other nonetheless.  If you still cannot connect to a server, see next section.
</ul>


<br><hr><br><a name="port">
<h2>Network port configuration</h2>

<p><strong>First note</strong> that if a local connexion doesn't work, you should try using the meta-server:
<ul>
<li>When you start the server, check "register to the meta-server".
<li>On the client, from BubBob's main page, go to the "Internet servers page".
</ul></p>

<p>If it doesn't help, and if you're technically inclined, read on.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Local connexions:</strong>
if you cannot see a server in the list of local servers, then:
<ul>
<li>Either the server is not local (i.e. not close enough, network-wise, from your machine).  In this case enter the full name of the server in the box below (it should look like <code>machinename.domain.com:1234</code>, as displayed on the server when it starts).
<li>Or the server is not listening on its UDP port 8056, meaning that this port was already in use (e.g. if you run several Bub's Brothers servers on the same machine, only one of them will show up); clients then have to enter the full name of the server as above.
<li>Or there is a firewall between you and the server. Try connecting through the meta-server. Alternatively, read on.
</ul></p>

<p>During a normal connexion (not going through the meta-server) the client needs to open a TCP connexion to the server.  The server can be configured to listen to a specific port ("TCP server port" of the configuration page) if you can let this port in through a firewall or router.</p>

<p>Servers listen to HTTP as well.  This is used for both the local BubBob pages (if you have a very restrictive firewall on your own machine then you might not be able to connect to your own machine, unless you let that port through) and for remote clients to which the server sends a Java applet.  You can force a port in "HTTP server port".  It default to 8000 if this port is free.</p>

<p>The server sends UDP datagrams to the clients during the game; if these ones don't pass through, they are re-routed over TCP, so it should just work.  Nevertheless you might prefer UDP for responsiveness.  The client can choose on which UDP port it will listen for incoming datagrams ("client incoming UDP port" of the configuration page) if you can let this port in through the firewall.</p>

<p>If a client has no way to establish a direct connexion but has an <code>ssh</code> account on a machine near the server, he can do:<br>
<code>ssh somewhere.domain.org -L1234:servername:4321</code><br>
where <code>servername:4321</code> is the full name of the server, and <code>1234</code> is some randomly choosen local port.  Then you can connect BubBob to <code>127.0.0.1:1234</code> using the <code>Go</code> button on the main page.  In this setting, if you can still let UDP datagrams enter, then configure "client incoming UDP port" to be not only the port but the whole name of the machine (or router) that the server must send the datagrams to.</p>

<br>

<a name="meta">
<p><strong>Meta-server connexions:</strong>
Connexions using the meta-server (with the "Internet server page" from BubBob's main page) work generally better than direct connexions, as long as the server and the client can independently connect to the meta-server (which is at <code>ctpug.org.za</code> using TCP ports 8050 and 8055). Firewalls and routers generally allow this. The meta-server will then co-operate with the server and the client to synchronize their connexion. (The meta-server will not route game data between the server and the client, though.)</p>

<p>This doesn't always work either, though.  If it does not, then you need to open a port on your side.  You have to configure your firewall and/or your NAT (e.g. your ADSL modem) to allow an incoming port.  In the NAT case, you have to say that communication arriving from outside at a TCP port of your choice (pick a number, say, between 8000 and 9999) should be sent to your computer (you have to enter its IP, as seen in the "network connexions" configuration).  You can then tell bub-n-bros to use this port: click on the Configuration link on the main page, scroll down to Network options, and enter the same port number in "Client incoming TCP port").</p>

<p>More technically, with the help of the meta-server, the games tries the following (in order):
<ol>
<li>The client tries to connect to the server normally, as in local connexions.  It fails if the server cannot be reached through a firewall or router.  To fix this, the person starting the server can open a TCP port and enter it in "TCP game server port" in the Configuration page.
<li>The client (through the meta-server) asks the server to try to connect backwards to the client.  This fails if the client cannot be reached through a firewall or router.  On the client, use "Client incoming TCP port" to fix a specific port that you can let in, as described above.
<li>They try to connect to each other using a technique known as simultaneous SYN exchanges.  In some cases it works even if both the client and the server are behind a firewall.  <i>This is not a way to hack through firewalls and break the security of a network, it is a perfectly official (if rarely used) way to connect two machines and it only works if the two machines are willing to actively connect to each other in the first place.</i>
</ol>

You can e-mail any question or trouble to me, <code>arigo</code>, at <code>users.sourceforge.net</code>, or join our IRC channel <code>#bub-n-bros</code> on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>.

<p>Please don't hesitate to contact me. As Bub &amp; Bros interacts with an external web browser to run, there are probably configurations that will break it.  It has been tested on Windows ME, MacOS X and Linux PCs, but this is no guarantee that it will always work -- far from it.
