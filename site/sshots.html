This is a typical six-players confused situation. &nbsp;Red and Brown have
just been killed here.<br>
Look carefully at Yellow, who is about to catch exactly the three letters
that he misses to complete the word "Extend" and get the 100'000 points bonus!<br>

&nbsp;The goal of the game is to throw bubbles and catch the monsters that
walk, fall or fly around.<br>
Then you run into the bubbles and make them explode.<br>
 <br>
  You get a fruit or diamond bonus for every dead monster.<br>
At that point, catch the bonuses before the other players do! &nbsp;Run for
diamonds!<br>

With some dexterity you can also catch other players or bonuses in bubbles.
&nbsp;The trick is to throw your bubble from precisely the correct distance.<br>

If a bonus is caught in a bubble, it will effect all dragons when the bubble
is exploded. &nbsp;This is a good way to give bad bonuses to everybody! &nbsp;But
sometimes the best bonuses themselves are caught in a bubble too and make
everyone happy...<br>

Everyone happy? &nbsp;No! &nbsp;Poor Brown has been caught in a bubble and
cannot receive the mega-bonus...<br>

to make as many points as possible. &nbsp;Players have unlimited lives and
don't get fired from a game. &nbsp;You must still avoid to die too often
because it makes you loose all the bonuses you recently got.<br>

Here White is loosing 100'000 points in the form of bunches of bananas and
peaches, some shoes, and many sugars.<br>
