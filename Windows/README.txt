Copy BubBob.exe into the directory bub-n-bros.

For Python 2.2:
  Copy wingame.pyd into the subdirectory bub-n-bros\display.
  Copy statesaver.pyd into the subdirectory bub-n-bros\bubbob.

For Python 2.3:
  Copy wingame23.pyd into the subdirectory bub-n-bros\display\wingame.pyd.
  Copy statesaver23.pyd into the subdirectory bub-n-bros\bubbob\statesaver.pyd.

Note that PythonBinaries.zip is not a complete Python
installation, because it doesn't include any standard .py file
although they are needed by the Bub's Brothers.  You still
have to install Python 2.2 or 2.3 first if you want to use the
CVS version of the Bub's Brothers.
